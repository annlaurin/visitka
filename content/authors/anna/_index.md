I am a cognitive scientist with a strong interest in computational cognitive modeling and the application of machine learning methods to cognitive science problems. In addition to holding a PhD in Cognitive Science, I have earned an MSc in Data Science. My most recent machine learning project involved pre-training and fine-tuning a transformer model to classify readers as dyslexic or typically developing based on their eye movements during reading. I am also interested in quantifying reading skills and investigating the factors that influence their development in second language learners and sign language users.

As a postdoc at [Shravan Vasishth](https://vasishth.github.io/)’s lab, I also work on such topics as reproducible statistical analyses and computational modeling of sentence processing, as well as teach data analysis at the [Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2024/).
