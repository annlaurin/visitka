I am a cognitive scientist interested in experimental research, computational conitive modeling, and machine learning. In addition to a PhD in Cognitive science, I am currently finishing a MSc degree in Data science, tackling the task of categorizing dyslexic readers based on their eye movements and the properties of the text they read. I'm also interested in quantifying reading skills and the factors affecting their development in L2 learners and sign language speakers.

As a postdoc at [Shravan Vasishth](https://vasishth.github.io/)’s lab, I also work on such topics as reproducible statistical analyses and computational modeling of sentence processing, as well as teach data analysis at the [Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2024/).
